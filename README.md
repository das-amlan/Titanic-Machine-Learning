# Titanic-Machine-Learning-R

My take on the analysis of the titanic dataset using R. Tried implementing different models. Got the highest accuracy with the Random forest model.
After submission got the score 0.77751 


Titanic ML competition is a well known chalange to familiarize oneself with the ML challanges.

## Target

The Target of the chalange is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
