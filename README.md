# Titanic-Machine-Learning-R

My take on the analysis of the titanic dataset using R. Tried implementing different models. Got the highest accuracy with the Random forest model.

After submission got the score 0.77751 

### About
Titanic ML competition is a well known chalange to familiarize oneself with ML challanges.

There are two dataset with same attributes:
1.train.csv
 -train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not.
2.test.csv
 -test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose if the passenger survivd or not. Itâ€™s our job to predict these outcomes.

### Target

The Target of the chalange is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
